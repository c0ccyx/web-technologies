    <h1>Music</h1>
    <p>I have to admit, before I started studying web dev, I was on doubts whether to pursue musical career or the web development one. As you can see, I chose the web development one and music is now my hobby. Still, I made two tiny albums which you can find here:
        <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/377i1FKjw6DxaZX0yhIjn9?si=yyLIw2-IRHmMktcEl8r0_g">Kiwi</a> and <a href="https://co-ccyx.bandcamp.com/album/weather-friends">Weather Friends</a>.</p>
